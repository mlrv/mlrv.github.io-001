# mlrv.github.io :space_invader:

This is my personal website, powered by [jqconsole](https://github.com/replit/jq-console). A big thanks goes to btroo (https://github.com/btroo), who truly inspired me with his work, the idea of this website is based on his work.

## Setup :wrench:
To run it locally, clone it somewhere on your pc with: 
```javascript
git clone https://github.com/mlrv/mlrv.github.io.git
```
I highly suggest installing [live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server), a little development server with live reload capability.
```javascript
npm install -g live-server
```
Some components are included through [browserify](http://browserify.org/). Everything that's exported by `module.js` is then bundled together in `bundle.js`, if you change any of those files you have to then run  `browserify js/module.js -o bundle.js`.

Feel free to clone it and play with it if you like.

N.B. the website doesn't work well on mobiles, so I disabled the main features. I might consider fixing it in the future.
