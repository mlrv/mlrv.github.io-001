[![Standard - JavaScript Style Guide](https://cdn.rawgit.com/feross/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/feross/standard)

This is my personal website, a big thanks goes to btroo (https://github.com/btroo), who truly inspired me with his work. The idea of this website is based on his work.

## Setup :wrench:
To run it locally, clone it somewhere on your pc with: 
```javascript
git clone https://github.com/mlrv/c0nsoleStyle
```
I highly suggest installing [live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server), a little development server with live reload capability.
```javascript
npm install -g live-server
```
Feel free to clone it and play with it if you like.

N.B. the website doesn't work well on mobiles, so I disabled the main features. I might consider fixing it in the future.
